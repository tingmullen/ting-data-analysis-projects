The WHERE tr.user_id IS NOT NULL clause then kicked out all those NULL rows, eliminating every book that hadn't been added to someone's reading list. This simple filter transformed the inclusive LEFT JOIN into the exclusive result set of an INNER JOIN."

This comprehensive view is perfect for data auditing, as it helps spot books that no one has marked yet. It also highlights any \"to read\" entries that link to a book ID that doesn't actually exist in the 'books' database.
