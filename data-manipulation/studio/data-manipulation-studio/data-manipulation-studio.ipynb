    "For this studio, we will revisit the data set from our last studio. If you recall, California farmers were looking for advice on growing pumpkins. We will use the same [pumpkins dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/usda/a-year-of-pumpkin-prices) as provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. You may have to clean data in the process of data manipulation, so feel free to pull up your notebook from the last class's studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now be focusing our attention on a different region in the United States, the Northeast. When you open up the `dataset` folder, you will have 13 CSVs, including the San Francisco and Los Angeles data from the last lesson. The 13 CSVs are each a different terminal market in the United States.\n",

    "A **terminal market** is a central site, often in a metropolitan area, that serves as an assembly and trading place for commodities.
