# Assign the variables for exercise 1 here:
engine_indicator_light = "red blinking"
space_suits_on = True
shuttle_cabin_ready = True
crew_status = space_suits_on and shuttle_cabin_ready 
computer_status_code = 200
shuttle_speed = 15000


# BEFORE running the code, predict what will be printed to the console by the following statements:

if engine_indicator_light == "green": 
  print("engines have started")
elif engine_indicator_light == "green blinking": 
  print("engines are preparing to start")
else:
  print("engines are off")

# The result is 'engines are off' .
