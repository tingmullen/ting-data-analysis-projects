## Set a variable called choice to the flavor you want to search for.
choice = 'strawberry'

## Use an if statement to check if choice is in the flavors dictionary.
if choice in flavors:
    
## If it is, set another variable called cost to the value associated with choice.
    cost = flavors[choice]

## If it isn’t, set cost to 0.
else:
   cost = 0

## Print the cost.
print(f"The cost of '{choice}' is: {cost}")
# The cost of 'strawberry' is: 0.42

### Search a Dictionary Part 2:

## Initialize two variables: highest_cost to 0 and fanciest to an empty string.
highest_cost = 0.0
fanciest = ""

## Loop through the flavors dictionary using a for loop.
for flavor, price in flavors.items():
    
## For each flavor, check if its price is higher than highest_cost.
    if price > highest_cost:
    
## If it is, update fanciest to this flavor and highest_cost to its price.
        highest_cost = price
        fanciest = flavor
## After the loop, print the most expensive flavor.
print(f"The most expensive flavor is '{fanciest}' with a cost of {highest_cost}.")
# The most expensive flavor is 'saffron' with a cost of 2.25.
